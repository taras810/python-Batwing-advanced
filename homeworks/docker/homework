1. Use the simple Flask application and build Dockerfile for it.
Create your own image (docker build) and try to run the container and interact with it by using your browser.
Don't forget to pass the valid ports by using -p. (e.g .: -p 8080: 8080)
Try to use such commands:
- docker run (with -d, -it, or without) {id}/{name},
- docker stop {id}/{name},
- docker attach {id}/{name},
- docker inspect {id}/{name},
- docker logs {id}/{name}
Change the flask application to print your name and rebuild the image. Run the container again to verify the result.

• docker run -it --name my_story ubuntu
• In the container, run echo "Your story" > story.txt
• Install cowsay with apt-get install cowsay and execute cat story.txt|cowsay.
• In another terminal window, run docker run -it --name my_story_2 ubuntu
• Using ls, check that there is no joke.txt file, because you are in another different container. Also,
there is no cowsay command.
